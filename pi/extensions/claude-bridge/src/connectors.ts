//
//   REQUEST side — anything passed INTO the SDK query options (`tools`,
//   `allowedTools`, `disallowedTools`, permission rules). These strings go
//   through the SDK's rule parser, which normalizes a request-side spelling
//   (`ListMcpResources`) through its alias map before matching. Constants that
//   feed only this surface keep the request-side spelling.
//
//   DELIVERED side — any name the CLI hands BACK to us at runtime: a PreToolUse
//   hook's `input.tool_name`, the stream's `content_block_start.name`,
//   assistant-message tool_use blocks. These carry the CANONICAL (aliased)
//   name (`ListMcpResourcesTool`), and nothing normalizes them for us — a raw
//   membership test against a request-side spelling silently never matches.
//
// This map declares each alias pair ONCE; every delivered-side membership set
// derives its spellings from it instead of hand-copying names. Both prior
// instances of the trap were exactly that hand-copy: CHILD_INTERNAL_TOOLS held
// request-side spellings that no stream name ever matched, and
// the connectors allowlist hook DENIED the two discovery tools it exists to

/**
 * Explicit `mcpServers` declarations for the account's CONNECTED connectors.
 *
 * Why this exists: claude.ai connectors load async and non-blocking,
 * and the turn-1 tool manifest is built at +410-665ms — roughly 300ms BEFORE the
 * CLI has even fetched the connector list. The model therefore composes its first
 * answer against a manifest containing no connectors and says it has no access,
 * while the connector attaches later and is never asked. The declaration must
 * be available before the first query. Confirmed at seven
 * declarations over a further 30 runs: 5/10 → 10/10 calls, 5/10 → 0/10 denials.
 *
 * It is also FASTER, which is the opposite of what the startup barrier suggests.
 * The barrier is real but small and sub-linear — manifest build 490ms none /
 * 1996ms one / 2574ms seven, so seven costs +578ms over one, not 7x. Meanwhile
 * first token drops from a 9840ms median (worst 35.7s) to 6887ms (worst 7.8s),
 * because declaring removes the model's speculative ToolSearch and dead ends.
 * The barrier buys back more than it spends.
 *
 * `alwaysLoad` is the mechanism: it blocks startup until the server is connected
 * (5s cap) precisely "since the tools must be present when the turn-1 prompt is
 * built". It is a field on the server config, so the connector has to be a server
 * WE declare — the CLI's own loader never applies it.
 *
 * Two things here are load-bearing and were established by measurement, not
 * inference:
 *
 * 1. The key MUST be the CLI's own server name (`connectorServerName`). The key
 *    is the tool namespace, so any other key yields the connector twice under two
 *    namespaces. Consumers that pin fully-qualified tool names rather than
 *    globbing a namespace then break.
 * 2. Only `installState === "connected"` connectors are declared. The rest are
 *    never attempted by the CLI either, and declaring them would mean asking
 *    `alwaysLoad` to block startup on servers that cannot connect.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT typed against the SDK's `McpServerConfig`: that exported union
 * omits the `claudeai-proxy` variant entirely, and its `McpClaudeAIProxyServerConfig`
 * has no `alwaysLoad` field — while the runtime zod schema in the shipped CLI does.
 * Typings and runtime disagree; the runtime honours `alwaysLoad` (verified live),
 * so this builds the object the runtime accepts and casts once, here, with the
 * reason recorded rather than spread across call sites.
